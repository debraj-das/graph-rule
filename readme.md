**🚀 Install the package**
   ```sh
   python setup.py install
   ```
   or 
   ```sh
   pip install -e .
   pip install requirements.txt
   ```

## 🧪 Quick Start


**Step 1. Run Rejection Steering**
   ```sh
   cd RS && bash scripts/full/run_rt_epoch_target.sh
   ```
**Step 2. Run Refusal Boundary Optimization**
   ```sh
   bash examples/exp_target/RWKU/run_llama_bs32_kl1e-2_forget_bf16_two_stage_reject_ref_rollout8_withformat_with_fb_neighbor_abs_lr2e-6.sh
   ```

## ⚙️ Configuration

- For RS:
Edit the `RS/scripts/full/run_rt_epoch_target.sh` script.

- For ReBO:
Edit YAML files in `examples/` to set hyperparameters, dataset paths, and model options.
