## ✨ Overview

![RULE Overview](img/overview.png)


We propose RULE, which views model unlearning as refusal-policy optimization and introduces an online RL–based refusal fine-tuning approach. This brings three key benefits:

- Natural, safe responses:
Prior methods often yield unnatural outputs after fine-tuning. By designing appropriate rewards, RULE induces refusal behavior on forget data, producing fluent and safe replies.

- Generalization beyond the forget/retain sets:
We introduce a simple, effective data synthesis strategy and leverage RL’s exploration on a boundary set. The model implicitly learns a refusal policy from rewards, improving generalization to unseen but related queries.

- A better forget–retain trade-off:
Because RL samples on-policy from the model’s own distribution, RULE better preserves the model’s knowledge while unlearning targeted content.

Empirically, on RWKU and MUSE-Book, RULE achieves a Pareto-optimal forget–retain frontier using only 10% of the forget and retain sets, while maintaining naturalness and general utility. Additional experiments show robustness to both black-box and white-box attacks, and compatibility with multiple reward designs and online RL algorithms.

> *TL;DR*: RULE learns **when and how** to refuse, achieving a strong **Pareto frontier** between forgetting and retention—without massive datasets.

## 📈 Key Findings
![img/exp.png](img/exp.png)

* **Natural refusals** on forget-related queries without collapsing helpfulness.
* **Data-efficient**: strong results with a **small fraction** of forget data + synthetic boundary data.
* **Pareto-optimal** trade-off between forgetting and retention.
* **Generalization** to unseen but semantically related queries.

## 🧪 Quick Start

### 1) Rejection Steering (RS)

```bash
cd RS && bash scripts/full/run_rt_epoch_target.sh
```

### 2) Refusal Boundary Optimization (ReBO)

```bash
bash examples/exp_target/RWKU/run_llama_bs32_kl1e-2_forget_bf16_two_stage_reject_ref_rollout8_withformat_with_fb_neighbor_abs_lr2e-6.sh
```

> **Tips**
>
> * Edit the RS runner at: `RS/scripts/full/run_rt_epoch_target.sh`.
> * Edit ReBO YAMLs under `examples/` for models, rewards, data paths, and hyperparameters.

---

## 🧰 Configuration

* **RS:**

  * Set the forget targets, reward weights, and sampler options in the runner script above.
* **ReBO:**

  * Control boundary synthesis, rollout length, reward shaping, and evaluation suites in `examples/**.yaml`.
